# BlackNest - Swift Test Breeding - Spec Based - Data Driven

## Want to test input combinations for a SUT?

Let's write a test for a simple function.
The simple function, which is by the way so easy that it will hardly fail,
looks like this:

```swift
/// Not that hard. 👍
func asTuple(_ int: Int) -> (Int, Int) {
  return (int, int * 2)
}
```
Before we write the test we add the spec:
A general function, taking `Input` and `Expected`.
This function performs all assertions in a DSL.
You can take whatever you want - Real Types, Tuples, Optionals. Feel free.

```swift
/// This is the spec.
/// The error message contains the values.
func doubleTuple(input: (Int), expect: (Int, Int)) throws -> (Int, Int) {
  // Act: do the tuple
  let subject = asTuple(input)

  // Assert: check the spec
  try subject.0 == expect.0
    => "first entry should be the same"
  try subject.1 == expect.1
    => "second entry should be duplicate"

  return subject
}
```
_Looks like an equation?_

__Yeah - no Boilerplate - pure definitions.__
Easy to re-read and remember.
Now we perform different combinations.

```swift
// You like named arguments?
expect(004, in:doubleTuple, is:(04, 08))
expect(008, in:doubleTuple, is:(08, 16))
expect(012, in:doubleTuple, is:(12, 24))
expect(100, in:doubleTuple, is:(100, 200))

// You like named arguments and custom operators?
expect(004, in: doubleTuple => (04, 08))
expect(008, in: doubleTuple => (08, 16))
expect(012, in: doubleTuple => (12, 24))
expect(100, in: doubleTuple => (100, 200))

// You're totally into custom operators?
expect(004 | doubleTuple => (04, 08))
expect(008 | doubleTuple => (08, 16))
expect(012 | doubleTuple => (12, 24))
expect(100 | doubleTuple => (100, 200))
```

What? It failed?
Relax - you will understand why:

## Want to test combinations of your tests?

Let's add another simple function.

```swift
/// Cool. 👍
func asSum(_ tuple: Int, Int) -> Int {
  return tuple.0 + tuple.1
}
```

And another test function for this.

```swift
func tupleSum(input: (Int, Int), expect: (Int)) throws -> Int {
  // Act: do the sum
  let subject = asSum(input)

  // Assert: check the spec
  try subject == expect
    => "sum calculation"

  return subject
}
```

Now you can __combine both__.
Each call to the test function can return and can take __individual expectations__.
__Return values will be carried on__ to the next test run.
Same code - no duplication - and again - easy to remember.

```swift
/// Again, you prefer multiline named arguments: Cool!
expect(04, in:doubleTuple, is:(04, 08)).then(tupleSum, is:12)
expect(08, in:doubleTuple, is:(08, 16)).then(tupleSum, is:24)
expect(12, in:doubleTuple, is:(12, 24)).then(tupleSum, is:36)

/// Custom operators from time to time?
expect(004 | doubleTuple => (04, 08)).then(tupleSum => 12)
expect(008 | doubleTuple => (08, 16)).then(tupleSum => 24)
expect(012 | doubleTuple => (12, 24)).then(tupleSum => 36)

/// Maybe table based is even better for your eyes?
expect(
   4 |  doubleTuple => (04, 08)
     |> tupleSum    => (12)
     |> doubleTuple => (12, 24)
     |> tupleSum    => (36)
 )

/// HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
/// ~ the egg operator ~
/// You took the red pill, and all you see is tests, tests, test.
expect(4,
  in: doubleTuple ◦ tupleSum ◦ doubleTuple ◦ tupleSum,
  is: (04, 08)    • 12       • (12, 24)    • 36
)

```

## Why BlackNest

Named after [Black-nest Swiftlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-nest_swiftlet).
All we want do in our tests, is take care of the precious eggs.
None should get a crack. That's it - taking care of your code.

## Why Custom Operators?

__You are not forced to use them.__
But when comparing both versions, sometimes custom
operators are easier to reason about.

How we call them? Just like their named argument counterpart.

`|`  is called _in_

`=>` is called _is_

 `|>` is called _then_
